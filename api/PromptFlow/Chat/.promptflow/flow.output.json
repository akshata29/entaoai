  "answer": "The process of preparing consolidated financial statements involves the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the subsidiary companies: The parent company identifies all its subsidiary entities, which are the companies it controls either directly or indirectly.\n\n2. Gather financial information: The parent company collects the financial statements of its subsidiaries, including balance sheets, income statements, statement of cash flows, and statement of changes in equity.\n\n3. Adjust subsidiary financials: The parent company makes adjustments to the financial information of the subsidiaries to ensure consistency in accounting policies and eliminate any intercompany transactions or balances. This is done to present a true and fair view of the group's financial position and performance.\n\n4. Eliminate intercompany transactions: Any transactions or balances between the parent company and its subsidiaries are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only external transactions.\n\n5. Consolidate financial statements: The parent company combines the adjusted financial information of all subsidiaries with its own financial statements. This includes consolidating the balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows.\n\n6. Calculate non-controlling interest: If the parent company does not own 100% of a subsidiary, it calculates the non-controlling interest (NCI) or minority interest. NCI represents the portion of the subsidiary's equity that is not owned by the parent company.\n\n7. Prepare consolidated financial statements: Finally, the parent company prepares the consolidated financial statements, which include the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of cash flows, and consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\nThroughout this process, the parent company ensures compliance with applicable accounting standards, such as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and provides appropriate disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements provide a comprehensive view of the financial performance and position of the entire group of companies under the parent's control.",

The Russia-related credits are mainly related to \ncorporate customers in Russia. \n\nFor losses expected to be incurred in connection with individual borrowers based on the impact of economic \nsanctions imposed by governments of each country and the countermeasures taken by the Russian government, \netc., a reserve for possible loan losses is provided by reviewing, as necessary, borrower categories based on the \nmost  recent  available  information.  In  addition,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  recorded  as  a  reserve  for \nclaims originated in specific overseas countries at an amount deemed necessary in consideration of the political \nand economic situation in Russia. \n\nFurthermore, in light of the probability of delays in principal or interest payments and the easing of payment \nterms, etc. due to the prolonged impact of such economic sanctions and countermeasures, and the deterioration in \nthe credit status of Russia including interest payments on Russian government bonds, a reserve for possible loan \nlosses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment. \n\nAlso,  regarding  certain  funds  of  repayment  from  customers  in  Russia,  given  the  prolonged  difficulty  in \ncollecting the funds through overseas remittances as a result of the Russian Presidential decree and instructions \nof the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the impact of the countermeasure is estimated, and a reserve for \npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment.   \n\nAs a result, a reserve for possible loan losses at a total of \u00a577,094 million was recorded for the Russia-related \n\ncredits. \n\n2.  The  estimates  of  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  related  to  the  impact  of  the  tightening  monetary  policies \n\noverseas \n\nConsidering the increasing burden of interest payments for companies due to tightening monetary policies in \nvarious  countries  following  suppressed  inflationary  pressures  overseas,  estimation  of  the  reserve  for  possible \nloan  losses  associated  with  such  impact  is  reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  by  the  following \nmethod. \n\nFor  potential  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  related  to  individual  borrowers  due  to  deteriorating  business \nperformance  and  funding,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  provided  by  reviewing,  as  necessary,  borrower \ncategory based on the most recent available information. \n\n\u201527\u2015 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn addition, for potential losses which cannot be reflected in any of individual borrower category, a reserve for \npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment. The assessment \nincludes specifying the portfolios that are considered to be easily affected by rising interest rates, and estimating \nthe impact of changes in the market condition and the rising interest rates. \n\nAs a result, an additional reserve for possible loan losses at a total of \u00a529,000 million was recorded for such \n\nportfolio. \n\n3.  The  estimates  of  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  based  on  the  current  situation  of  the  spread  of  the  novel \n\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) \n\nThe  current  situation  regarding  the  spread  of  COVID-19  appeared  to  have  stabilized  to  some  extent  as  the \nJapanese government has downgraded its classification of COVID-19 under the Infectious Diseases Control Law \nto Class V. However, for certain portfolios, considering concerns over the future deterioration in credit conditions \ndue to cease of government financial support and establishment of the new normal way of life, the estimation of \nthe  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  associated  with  such  impact  is  reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial \nstatements by the following method. \n\nFor  potential  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  related  to  individual  borrowers  due  to  deterioration  in  business \nperformance  and  funding,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  provided  by  reviewing,  as  necessary,  borrower \ncategory based on the most recent available information. \n\nIn addition, for potential losses which cannot be reflected in any of individual borrower category, a reserve for \npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment.

Transition from the consolidated corporate-tax system to the group tax sharing system \n\nThe Company and certain consolidated domestic subsidiaries transitioned from the consolidated corporate-tax \nsystem  to  the  group  tax  sharing  system  from  the  fiscal  year  ended  March  31,  2023.  In  accordance  with  the \ntransition, the accounting treatment and disclosure of corporate tax, local tax, and tax effect accounting are based \non \u201cPractical Solution on the Accounting and Disclosure Under the Group Tax Sharing System\u201d (ASBJ Practical \nIssue Task Force No.42, August 12, 2021).

(hereinafter, \u201cSMBC Nikko Securities\u201d), a consolidated \nsubsidiary of the Company, and its former executive officers and employees, on suspicion of illegal stabilization \ntransactions.

The Russia-related credits are mainly related to \ncorporate customers in Russia. \n\nFor losses expected to be incurred in connection with individual borrowers based on the impact of economic \nsanctions imposed by governments of each country and the countermeasures taken by the Russian government, \netc., a reserve for possible loan losses is provided by reviewing, as necessary, borrower categories based on the \nmost  recent  available  information.  In  addition,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  recorded  as  a  reserve  for \nclaims originated in specific overseas countries at an amount deemed necessary in consideration of the political \nand economic situation in Russia. \n\nFurthermore, in light of the probability of delays in principal or interest payments and the easing of payment \nterms, etc. due to the prolonged impact of such economic sanctions and countermeasures, and the deterioration in \nthe credit status of Russia including interest payments on Russian government bonds, a reserve for possible loan \nlosses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment. \n\nAlso,  regarding  certain  funds  of  repayment  from  customers  in  Russia,  given  the  prolonged  difficulty  in \ncollecting the funds through overseas remittances as a result of the Russian Presidential decree and instructions \nof the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the impact of the countermeasure is estimated, and a reserve for \npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment.   \n\nAs a result, a reserve for possible loan losses at a total of \u00a577,094 million was recorded for the Russia-related \n\ncredits. \n\n2.  The  estimates  of  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  related  to  the  impact  of  the  tightening  monetary  policies \n\noverseas \n\nConsidering the increasing burden of interest payments for companies due to tightening monetary policies in \nvarious  countries  following  suppressed  inflationary  pressures  overseas,  estimation  of  the  reserve  for  possible \nloan  losses  associated  with  such  impact  is  reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  by  the  following \nmethod. \n\nFor  potential  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  related  to  individual  borrowers  due  to  deteriorating  business \nperformance  and  funding,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  provided  by  reviewing,  as  necessary,  borrower \ncategory based on the most recent available information. \n\n\u201527\u2015 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn addition, for potential losses which cannot be reflected in any of individual borrower category, a reserve for \npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment.

The  estimates  of  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  based  on  the  current  situation  of  the  spread  of  the  novel \n\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) \n\nThe  current  situation  regarding  the  spread  of  COVID-19  appeared  to  have  stabilized  to  some  extent  as  the \nJapanese government has downgraded its classification of COVID-19 under the Infectious Diseases Control Law \nto Class V. However, for certain portfolios, considering concerns over the future deterioration in credit conditions \ndue to cease of government financial support and establishment of the new normal way of life, the estimation of \nthe  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  associated  with  such  impact  is  reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial \nstatements by the following method. \n\nFor  potential  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  related  to  individual  borrowers  due  to  deterioration  in  business \nperformance  and  funding,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  provided  by  reviewing,  as  necessary,  borrower \ncategory based on the most recent available information. \n\nIn addition, for potential losses which cannot be reflected in any of individual borrower category, a reserve for \npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment.

          "answer": "The process of preparing consolidated financial statements involves the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the subsidiary companies: The parent company identifies all its subsidiary entities, which are the companies it controls either directly or indirectly.\n\n2. Gather financial information: The parent company collects the financial statements of its subsidiaries, including balance sheets, income statements, statement of cash flows, and statement of changes in equity.\n\n3. Adjust subsidiary financials: The parent company makes adjustments to the financial information of the subsidiaries to ensure consistency in accounting policies and eliminate any intercompany transactions or balances. This is done to present a true and fair view of the group's financial position and performance.\n\n4. Eliminate intercompany transactions: Any transactions or balances between the parent company and its subsidiaries are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only external transactions.\n\n5. Consolidate financial statements: The parent company combines the adjusted financial information of all subsidiaries with its own financial statements. This includes consolidating the balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows.\n\n6. Calculate non-controlling interest: If the parent company does not own 100% of a subsidiary, it calculates the non-controlling interest (NCI) or minority interest. NCI represents the portion of the subsidiary's equity that is not owned by the parent company.\n\n7. Prepare consolidated financial statements: Finally, the parent company prepares the consolidated financial statements, which include the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of cash flows, and consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\nThroughout this process, the parent company ensures compliance with applicable accounting standards, such as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and provides appropriate disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements provide a comprehensive view of the financial performance and position of the entire group of companies under the parent's control.",

If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion.

The  estimates  of  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  related  to  the  impact  of  the  current  international  situation \\n\\ninvolving Ukraine. \\n\\nConsidering  the  uncertain  business  environment  caused  by  the  current  international  situation  involving \\nUkraine, estimation of the reserve for possible loan losses associated with the Russia-related credits is reflected \\nin the consolidated financial statements by the following method. The Russia-related credits are mainly related to \\ncorporate customers in Russia. \\n\\nFor losses expected to be incurred in connection with individual borrowers based on the impact of economic \\nsanctions imposed by governments of each country and the countermeasures taken by the Russian government, \\netc., a reserve for possible loan losses is provided by reviewing, as necessary, borrower categories based on the \\nmost  recent  available  information.  In  addition,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  recorded  as  a  reserve  for \\nclaims originated in specific overseas countries at an amount deemed necessary in consideration of the political \\nand economic situation in Russia. \\n\\nFurthermore, in light of the probability of delays in principal or interest payments and the easing of payment \\nterms, etc. due to the prolonged impact of such economic sanctions and countermeasures, and the deterioration in \\nthe credit status of Russia including interest payments on Russian government bonds, a reserve for possible loan \\nlosses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment. \\n\\nAlso,  regarding  certain  funds  of  repayment  from  customers  in  Russia,  given  the  prolonged  difficulty  in \\ncollecting the funds through overseas remittances as a result of the Russian Presidential decree and instructions \\nof the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the impact of the countermeasure is estimated, and a reserve for \\npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment.   \\n\\nAs a result, a reserve for possible loan losses at a total of \u00a577,094 million was recorded for the Russia-related \\n\\ncredits. \\n\\n2.  The  estimates  of  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  related  to  the  impact  of  the  tightening  monetary  policies \\n\\noverseas \\n\\nConsidering the increasing burden of interest payments for companies due to tightening monetary policies in \\nvarious  countries  following  suppressed  inflationary  pressures  overseas,  estimation  of  the  reserve  for  possible \\nloan  losses  associated  with  such  impact  is  reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  by  the  following \\nmethod. \\n\\nFor  potential  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  related  to  individual  borrowers  due  to  deteriorating  business \\nperformance  and  funding,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  provided  by  reviewing,  as  necessary,  borrower \\ncategory based on the most recent available information. \\n\\n\u201527\u2015 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIn addition, for potential losses which cannot be reflected in any of individual borrower category, a reserve for \\npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment. The assessment \\nincludes specifying the portfolios that are considered to be easily affected by rising interest rates, and estimating \\nthe impact of changes in the market condition and the rising interest rates. \\n\\nAs a result, an additional reserve for possible loan losses at a total of \u00a529,000 million was recorded for such \\n\\nportfolio. \\n\\n3.  The  estimates  of  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  based  on  the  current  situation  of  the  spread  of  the  novel \\n\\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) \\n\\nThe  current  situation  regarding  the  spread  of  COVID-19  appeared  to  have  stabilized  to  some  extent  as  the \\nJapanese government has downgraded its classification of COVID-19 under the Infectious Diseases Control Law \\nto Class V. However, for certain portfolios, considering concerns over the future deterioration in credit conditions \\ndue to cease of government financial support and establishment of the new normal way of life, the estimation of \\nthe  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  associated  with  such  impact  is  reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial \\nstatements by the following method. \\n\\nFor  potential  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  related  to  individual  borrowers  due  to  deterioration  in  business \\nperformance  and  funding,  a  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses  is  provided  by  reviewing,  as  necessary,  borrower \\ncategory based on the most recent available information. \\n\\nIn addition, for potential losses which cannot be reflected in any of individual borrower category, a reserve for \\npossible loan losses is recorded at an amount deemed necessary based on an overall assessment. The assessment \\nincludes specifying the portfolios that are considered to be easily affected by the abovementioned factors from \\nperspectives  of  industry  and  ability  of  debt  repayment,  and  estimating  the  impact  of  changes  in  the  market \\ncondition, etc. \\n\\n4. Transition from the consolidated corporate-tax system to the group tax sharing system \\n\\nThe Company and certain consolidated domestic subsidiaries transitioned from the consolidated corporate-tax \\nsystem  to  the  group  tax  sharing  system  from  the  fiscal  year  ended  March  31,  2023.  In  accordance  with  the \\ntransition, the accounting treatment and disclosure of corporate tax, local tax, and tax effect accounting are based \\non \u201cPractical Solution on the Accounting and Disclosure Under the Group Tax Sharing System\u201d (ASBJ Practical \\nIssue Task Force No.42, August 12, 2021). Based on Paragraph 32(1) of ASBJ Practical Issue Task Force No.42, \\nit is deemed that changes in accounting policy by applying ASBJ Practical Issue Task Force No.42 have no effect. \\n\\n5. Suspected illegal stabilization transactions \\n\\nOn March 24 and April 13, 2022, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office filed charges with the Tokyo \\nDistrict Court to prosecute SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. (hereinafter, \u201cSMBC Nikko Securities\u201d), a consolidated \\nsubsidiary of the Company, and its former executive officers and employees, on suspicion of illegal stabilization \\ntransactions.
