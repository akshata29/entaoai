These conference calls are transcribed by several service providers and can be accessed by subscribers of large financial data providers.\n",
    "3. Press Release: Can be found in the investor relations section of most companies' websites and contains the financial statements which are used in forms 10-K and 10-Q. \n",
    "4. News: News articles that may affect a company's stock price or growth prospect would be something that analysts look into, particularly within a 6-12 month time horizon.\n",
    "5. SEC filings: These regulatory documents require a company to file Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the SEC on an ongoing basis. Form 10-K is a financial overview and commentary for the last year, usually found on the company's website. Form 10-Q is similar to form 10-K, but it is a report for the last quarter instead of the previous year.\n",
