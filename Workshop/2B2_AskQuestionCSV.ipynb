The borrower's consent is specific to the transaction but may be utilized by the investor, servicer, or in quality control or audit scenarios after loan closing. While the lender may not use tax transcript information for marketing purposes, the investor or servicer could potentially use the information for their own purposes, as outlined in their Privacy Notice. The borrower is required to sign this disclosure in order to proceed with the loan.
